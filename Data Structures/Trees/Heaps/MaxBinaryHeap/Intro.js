 * -- Each parent has atmost 2 child nodes.
 * -- The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes.
 * -- In this type of heap, parent is greater than the children, but there is no guarentee between sibling and nodes
 * -- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be & left child is filled first.
